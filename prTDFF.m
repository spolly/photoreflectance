function f=prTDFF(x,Eg,gamma,theta,m,A)
% prTDFF returns the calculated low-field deltaR/R based on several inputs.
%   Inputs:
%        x: Energy [eV] {vector expected}
%       Eg: Oscillator energy [eV] {scalar expected}
%    gamma: Broadning factor [eV] {scalar expected}
%       hO: Electro-optical energy [eV] {scalar expected}
%    theta: Phase term [radians] {scalar expected}
%        m: Exponent (from dimentionality of CPs) [unitless] 
%            {scalar expected}
%        A: Amplitude factor [unitless] {scalar expected}
%   Outputs:
%        f: delR/R [proportinal to eV^3] {vector}
%
%   If all values in [eV] are replaced with [J], the function is still
%   valid, though that may only hold for this file and not the overall 
%   program. The formula is taken from eq. 4a, page 284 of [1].
